## Problem: How do we increase the total amount of social good in our community?
People want to volunteer/organize charitable events, but find that there are several barriers:
- 💵 High fixed costs (e.g. you need 10 tables, or to rent a car)
- 🙋🏼 Hard to find specialized volunteers (e.g. food handling requirements, minimum age requirement)
- 👪 Low impact if you can't find enough volunteers

## Our Solution
We created HumanKynd, a platform that allows anyone to volunteer, donate, or provide suggestions to charitable events.

### Features
- 💜 Allows you to create and manage charitable events
- 💚 When people view your event, they can donate money, let you borrow equipment, or volunteer
- 🔎 You can find new events based on causes you're passionate about, or via skills/certifications (Foodsafe, organizing large events, driving)
